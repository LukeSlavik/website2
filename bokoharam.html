<h4 style="color: green;">What steps are they taking to help?</h4>
<p style="color: orange;">The United States for the third time in three years are moving towards selling 12 Super Tucano attack planes. The Obama Administration stopped the proposed sale, two years ago, after a Nigerian fighter jet looking for members of Boko Haram accidentally dropped bombs on refugees, killing some and wounding others. Last year in February Trump had a conversation with the president of Nigeria saying he would take a look at the proposal again. The White House made a statement that President Trump shows support for the sale to happen to support Nigeria's fight against Boko Haram. officials from the state department, the pentagon, and The White House said the sale of the attack planes would be valued at $600 million, and would help the Nigerian Air Force battle Boko Haram.</p>
<h4 style="color: green;">How are they staying out of it?</h4>
<p style="color: orange;">The United States for the most part are staying out of the fight against Boko Haram. "And the U.S. under President Barack Obama has been reluctant to intervene where it believes America does not have obvious security concerns". The United States have not been very willing to join the fight against the cutthroats of Nigeria. One reason Western powers including the U.S. are staying out of it, is because these African terrorists across the ocean do not directly threaten them. The United States has not sent troops to Nigeria showing they want to keep their military personnel away from the insurgency of Boko Haram. Overall the United States are giving little help to their allies of Nigeria and aren't willing to put their troops on the ground but they do give them support in other ways.</p>
